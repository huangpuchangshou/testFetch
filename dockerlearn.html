<H1 Introduction to Docker and Containers />

Old Applications: monolithic even load balanced.

New Application:
  1> Applications are constantly build
  2> New version are been deployed often
  3> Build from loose-coupled components
  4> Deploy to multiple servers
  
  
Container make your application portable:
1> It looks the same everywhere
2> 所有依赖自包含。
Docker: One container run everywhere

Docker launched at 2013:
  
  
  Docker makes your applicaiton shareable via docker file: sample
  
    FROM ubuntu:14.04
    RUN apt-get install -y redis-server
    EXPOSE 6379   【打开端口】
    ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/redis-server"]
    
    
    
  容器包含了所有的环境运行依赖：二进制文件；Lib；File System； 但是还要依赖<bold 宿主机的网络和内核/>
  
  
  No need to run entire OS, leave your host OS clean.
